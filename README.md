# nfl_scrapy
Using scrapy to crawl into nfl salary ranks

The idea behind is to use sracpy as a spider to crawl into url https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rankings/ and retrieve player rank, name, position and Cap Hit. 

To run the spider excecute the command scrapy crawl nfl inside your terminal.

The command will create a csv file named 'test.csv' with the result output.
